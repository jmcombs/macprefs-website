## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

These are real-world examples of what goes wrong when ephemeral keys are migrated. Use this section to understand **why** the manual curation workflow is necessary.

### Pitfall 1: Migrating Window Frame Settings

**Problem**: You export window positions from a 27" iMac and apply them to a 14" MacBook.

```json
// DON'T migrate these
"NSWindow Frame MainWindow": "728 469 1104 471 0 0 2560 1415"
```

Windows end up off-screen or sized incorrectly.

**Solution**: macprefs recommends excluding all `NSWindow Frame *` keys. Your apps will remember their positions after you arrange them once.

### Pitfall 2: UUID Conflicts

**Problem**: Device-specific UUIDs get migrated and conflict with the new Mac's identifiers.

```json
// DON'T migrate these
"GuestPassDeviceUUID": "89093FFD-2653-4340-B8EE-0E688CA3C564",
"LastBootUUID": "F5D7B691-8542-4CA2-820D-97FD524F0589"
```

**Solution**: Never include keys ending in `UUID` or containing `BootSession` in your migration config.

### Pitfall 3: Cache Timestamps

**Problem**: Migrated timestamps confuse cache invalidation and update checking.

```json
// DON'T migrate these
"CKStartupTime": 1768687416,
"LastUpdatesCheck": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
```

**Solution**: Exclude all `*Time`, `*Date`, and `*Check` keys that represent temporal data.

### Pitfall 4: User Path Dependencies

**Problem**: Paths referencing your old username break on the new Mac.

```json
// DON'T migrate these
"RecentDocuments": ["/Users/oldname/Documents/..."]
```

**Solution**: Avoid migrating Recent* and path-containing keys. iCloud sync handles documents.

### Pitfall 5: Importing Too Many Domains

**Problem**: Attempting to migrate every preference domain causes conflicts.

**Solution**: Start with essential domains only:

```bash
# Focus on what matters
macprefs export --domains com.apple.dock,com.apple.finder,NSGlobalDomain focused-prefs.json
```
