# Fleet Management Guide

<Aside type="caution" title="Coming Soon">
Fleet management features are planned for a future release. This guide will be updated when enterprise fleet management capabilities become available.
</Aside>

## Planned Features

The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Centralized Configuration** — Store configurations in a central Git repository
- **Team Collaboration** — Share configuration files for consistent team setups
- **Compliance Checking** — Verify machines match expected state
- **Audit Trail** — Track all changes with timestamps and previous values
- **Gradual Rollout** — Test changes on a subset of machines first
- **Environment-specific Configs** — Different settings for dev vs. production

## Current Alternatives

For now, you can achieve basic multi-machine management using:

1. **Git-based sync** — See the [Power Users Guide](/guides/power-users/) for Git workflows
2. **CI/CD automation** — See the [CI/CD Guide](/guides/ci-cd/) for automation patterns
3. **Manual distribution** — Share config files via your existing deployment tools
