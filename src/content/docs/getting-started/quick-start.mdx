# Quick Start

Get started with macprefs in just a few minutes.

## Initialize Configuration

Create a new macprefs configuration in your current directory:

```bash
macprefs init
```

This creates a `preferences.json` file with a basic structure.

## View Current Preferences

See what preferences are currently set on your system:

```bash
macprefs plan
```

The plan command shows you what changes would be made without applying them.

## Apply Configuration

Once you're happy with your configuration, apply it:

```bash
macprefs apply
```

## Rollback Changes

Made a mistake? Rollback to the previous state:

```bash
macprefs rollback
```
