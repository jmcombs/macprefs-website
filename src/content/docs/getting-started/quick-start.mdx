Get started with macprefs in just a few minutes.

<Steps>

1. ## Install macprefs

   Install macprefs via Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install macprefs
   ```

2. ## Run Preflight Check

   Verify your system is ready:

   ```bash
   macprefs preflight
   ```

   This checks system permissions, disk space, and other prerequisites.

3. ## Export Current Preferences

   Capture your current system preferences to a config file:

   ```bash
   macprefs export my-prefs.json
   ```

   This creates a JSON file with your current settings that you can customize.

4. ## Preview Changes

   Before applying a configuration, preview what would change:

   ```bash
   macprefs plan --config my-prefs.json
   ```

   The plan command shows a diff of changes without modifying anything.

5. ## Apply Configuration

   Once you're happy with the planned changes, apply them:

   ```bash
   macprefs apply --config my-prefs.json
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
   A snapshot is automatically created before applying, so you can always rollback.
   </Aside>

6. ## Rollback if Needed

   Made a mistake? Rollback to the previous state:

   ```bash
   macprefs rollback
   ```
